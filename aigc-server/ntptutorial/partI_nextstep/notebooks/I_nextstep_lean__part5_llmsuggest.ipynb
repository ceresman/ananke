    "### High-level approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing `llmsuggest` involves three components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A Lean *tactic* that sends the current state to a Python script.\n",
    "2. A Python script that sends the current state to a server via a POST request.\n",
    "3. A Python server that runs our next-step suggestion model on the current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggestions (3) are sent back to (2), and the tactic (1) displays the result in VSCode.\n",

   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "#### 1. Tactic\n",
    "\n",
    "At a technical level, the proofs we have seen are actually sequences of *tactics*. \n",
    "For instance, `intro` is a tactic and `rw [...]` is a tactic. In general, a *tactic* is a Lean program that manipulates a state. \n",
    "\n",
    "To build a new tactic, we use *Lean metaprogramming*, which gives us tools to define new syntax, access the proof state, and more. \\\n",
    "`llmsuggest` only requires basic metaprogramming. To learn more, see the [Lean 4 metaprogramming book](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4-metaprogramming-book/tree/master).\n",
    "\n",
    "`llmsuggest` is implemented in `ntp_lean/LLMsuggest.lean`. The main definition specifies the syntax (i.e., `\"llmsuggest\"`), then defines the tactic. \\\n",
    "You can see below that the tactic gets the main goal (the \"tactic state\"), pretty-prints it, and converts it to a string.\n",
    "Then it runs a `runSuggest` function, and passes the output to an `addSuggestions` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```lean\n",
    "-- `llmsuggest` tactic.\n",
    "syntax \"llmsuggest\" : tactic\n",
    "elab_rules : tactic\n",
    "  | `(tactic | llmsuggest%$tac) =>\n",
    "    Lean.Elab.Tactic.withMainContext do\n",
    "      let goal ← Lean.Elab.Tactic.getMainGoal\n",
    "      let ppgoal ← Lean.Meta.ppGoal goal\n",
    "      let ppgoalstr := toString ppgoal\n",
    "      let suggest ← runSuggest #[ppgoalstr]\n",
    "      addSuggestions tac $ suggest.splitOn \"[SUGGESTION]\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `runSuggest` function calls a Python script (step 2 above), and the `addSuggestions` uses a Lean widget to display the results in VSCode. \\\n",
    "We won't look at these in detail, but please see `ntp_lean/LLMsuggest.lean` if you are curious. \\\n",
    "Hopefully with a small amount of effort, you can modify the tactic or make your own in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Python script\n",
    "\n",
    "The `runSuggest` function in the tactic calls a Python script, `ntp_python/llmsuggest/suggest.py`. It passes the current tactic state as a command line argument.\\\n",
    "The script is simple: it sends a POST request containing the current tactic state to a server:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def suggest(tactic_state):\n",
    "    conn = http.client.HTTPConnection(\"localhost\", 5000)\n",
    "    headers = {'Content-type': 'application/json'}\n",
    "    body = json.dumps({\"tactic_state\": sys.argv[1]})\n",
    "    conn.request(\"POST\", \"/\", body, headers)\n",
    "    response = conn.getresponse()\n",
    "    data = response.read()\n",
    "    data_dict = json.loads(data)\n",
    "    print('[SUGGESTION]'.join(data_dict['suggestions']))\n",
    "    conn.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    suggest(sys.argv[1])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After receiving suggestions, it prints the suggestions, and the printed suggestions will be received in the `runSuggest` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Server\n",
    "Finally, in `ntp_python/llmsuggest/server.py` we define a web server that handles the POST request, and hosts the language model.\n",
    "Specifically, the server initializes our language model, and uses the model to\n",
    "generate suggestions given a tactic state received in a POST request.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model = transformers.GPTNeoXForCausalLM.from_pretrained('wellecks/llmstep-mathlib4-pythia2.8b')\n",
    "\n",
    "def generate ...\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/', methods=['POST'])\n",
    "def process_request():\n",
    "    data = request.get_json()\n",
    "    tactic_state = data.get('tactic_state')\n",
    "    prompt = \"\"\"[GOAL]%s[PROOFSTEP]\"\"\" % (tactic_state)\n",
    "    texts = generate(prompt, args.num_samples)\n",
    "    response = {\"suggestions\": texts}\n",
    "    return jsonify(response)\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=args.port)\n",
